# Create your first USB Host Application

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a MPLAB® Harmony 3 project that uses the MPLAB® Harmony File System to create a file on a USB Mass Storage Device (eg: USB Pen Drive). The application will provide a LED indication when the file create process has completed.

This tutorial focuses on using the interoperable MPLAB® Harmony USB Host stack and Harmony File System service in your application.
