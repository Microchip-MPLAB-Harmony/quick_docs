# WINC Driver Architecture

This section describes the WINC Driver Library. This Driver supports both ATWINC1500 and ATWINC3400.

The MPLAB Harmony WINC Driver provides a high-level interface to the ATWINC1500 and ATWINC3400 Wi-Fi network controller modules. The WINC Driver Library, in conjunction with the ATWINC1500 or ATWINC3400 module, allows an application to:
- Join an existing 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Infrastructure network.
- Create an 802.11 Wi-Fi Ad Hoc of Soft AP network.
- Scan for other W-Fi devices in an area
- Supports BLE 4.0 provisioning and profiles in central and peripheral mode (ATWINC3400 only)
