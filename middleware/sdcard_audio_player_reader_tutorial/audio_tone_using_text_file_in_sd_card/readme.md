# Lab 2: Audio-Tone Generation from a Text File Stored in an SD Card with Harmony v3


This lab adds to the **previous one**. The *audio_player_lab2* application reads an audio text file from the [PIC32 Multimedia Expansion Board II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320005-5) SD card and streams it over the PIC32 IÂ²S interface to the audio CODEC. The audio file is saved as a .txt file with comma-separated left and right channel audio data. The *audio_player_lab2* application demonstrates the configuration and integration of the additional modules to *audio_player_lab1* using MHC, thereby extending its functionality.

**Note**: This tutorial is a reference only to the existing users of Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) to port/develop their application(s) using MPLAB Harmony v3 as the Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) is now a matured product and the same is not available for purchase from Microchip Direct.
