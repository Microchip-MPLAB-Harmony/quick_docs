# Lab 1: Audio-Tone Generation Using a Lookup Table with Harmony v3


In this lab, you will create a simple MPLAB Harmony project from scratch. You will use the MHC to configure the codec on the [PIC32 Multimedia Expansion Board II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320005-5). The application streams an audio tone (stored in the form of a lookup table in memory) over the IÂ²S interface which gets played on the audio codec.

**Note**: This tutorial is a reference only to the existing users of Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) to port/develop their application(s) using MPLAB Harmony v3 as the Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) is now a matured product and the same is not available for purchase from Microchip Direct.
