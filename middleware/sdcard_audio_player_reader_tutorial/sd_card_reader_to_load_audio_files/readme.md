# Lab3: SD Card Reader Support to Load Audio Files with Harmony v3

This lab extends **previous one** by adding Secure Digital (SD) card reader functionality. The *audio_player_lab3* application shows how to edit the contents of an SD card. The [PIC32 Multimedia Expansion Board II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320005-5) is connected to a USB host, (typically a PC) and after a successful enumeration, the SD card is presented as a mass storage drive on the PC allowing you to add or delete contents.

**Note**: This tutorial is a reference only to the existing users of Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) to port/develop their application(s) using MPLAB Harmony v3 as the Multimedia Expansion Board II (MEB II) is now a matured product and the same is not available for purchase from Microchip Direct.
