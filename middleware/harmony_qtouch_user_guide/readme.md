# QTouch® Modular Library Peripheral Touch Controller User's Guide


The Microchip QTouch® Peripheral Touch Controller (PTC) offers built-in hardware for capacitive touch measurement on sensors that function as buttons, sliders, and wheels. The PTC supports both mutual and self-capacitance measurement without the need for any external component. It offers superb sensitivity and noise tolerance, as well as self-calibration, and minimizes the sensitivity tuning effort by the user. It also extends the support for capacitive touch surface and gesture functionality.
