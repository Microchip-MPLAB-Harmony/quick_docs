# Creating Your First Bluetooth Application from Scratch

This page provides a user a quick start guide for building their first Bluetooth project in Harmony 3.

This tutorial provides information on how to create a Bluetooth project using MPLAB Harmony 3. To keep the application as simple as possible, a very minimal UI is included (one button and one LED). It connects to a smartphone (iPhone or Android) using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), and sends a string of characters to the smartphone when a button is pressed.

The following hardware setup is supported:

- [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)
- [BM64 Bluetooth Radio Daughter Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/AC320032-3)
