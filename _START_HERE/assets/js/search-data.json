The Clock Easy View window will be displayed inside the MHC Window. | In the Clock Easy View window, scroll to the right and verify that the Main Clock is set to 48 MHz. . | To add and configure the USART Peripheral Library follow these steps: Under Available Components, expand Peripherals and then expand the options available for SERCOM. | Double-click on the SERCOM3 to add it to the project | . | Select the SERCOM3 Peripheral Library in the Project Graph, and in the Configuration Options window, configure it as follows: SERCOM Operation mode is set for USART with Internal Clock (default setting). | Clear Receive Enable, as the string will only be transmitted in this example. | Set the Baud Rate to 9600. | For Transmit Pinout choose SERCOM PAD[0] (default setting). | By default, the Receive Pinout is SERCOM PAD[0]. If the Receive Pinout feature is disabled, it will not affect the operation. | . | Configure the USART pin in the Pin Settings: In the MHC, select Tools &gt; Pin Configuration to open the Pin Settings window. | The MHC Pin Settings window will open and display these options: Pin Diagram, Pin Table, and Pin Settings. Note: According to the schematic of the SAMD21 Xplained Pro board, the on-board Embedded Debugger (EDBG) can be used as Virtual Com Port to have serial communication between the SAMD21 device and a connected computer console. Therefore, the PA22 (Pin #43) of the SAMD21 must be configured as USART_TX (SERCOM3 PAD0). | Click the Pin Settings tab and configure the PA22 pin as SERCOM3_PAD0. | The same pin (PA22) can be configured by clicking the Pin Table tab. Note: The USART_TX function (Transmit Pinout) is by default configured to be on SERCOM3 PAD0, for additional information, refer to MHC SERCOM Configuration. | In the SERCOM3 USART configuration, the USART is enabled only for transmit functionality. Therefore, the USART receive pin is not configured. | | Step 3: To generate the code, follow these steps: . In MHC click on the Save MHC State icon to save the MHC state before generating the code. . | Save the configuration in its default location, when prompted. | Click on the generate code icon to generate the code. . | The Modified Configuration window is prompted, click Save to save the configuration. . | In the Generate Project window, click Generate to generate the code. | The above step triggers these actions in MHC: Generate the code as per the configurations done. | Place the generated code and required MPLAB Harmony framework files in the MPLAB Harmony project directory, in this case: D: microchip github h3 tech_brief firmware src. | Add all generated codes and MPLAB Harmony framework files into the MPLAB Harmony project, as shown in the following figure. Note: The MPLAB Harmony project will be shown in another window as this project is in Standalone mode. | . | The generated code descriptions are as follows: . definitions.h: Includes all the header files required for the project. | initialization.c: Initializes all the MPLAB Harmony modules used in the application. | interrupts.c: Contains the mapping of all the interrupt vectors on the selected device. | main.c: A function call to initialize the system present in this file. The user needs to develop their application in this file. | peripheral: All peripheral source codes are added in this folder. Note: The MHC provides an option to change the generated file name, and if this option is not used, by default, the file name main.c is generated. | . | Note: The MHC provides an option to change the generated file name, and if this option is not used, by default, the file name main.c is generated. . Step 4: To develop and run an application, follow these steps: . Developing an application: For this demo application, add the highlighted codes (as shown in image below) in the main.c file. This will send the “Hello World!” string to the console running on the PC. The following code is provided for convenience: | uint8_t buffer[]= &quot;Hello World! r n&quot;; SERCOM3_USART_Write(&amp;buffer[0], sizeof(buffer)); . . Selecting Hardware Tool and Compiler: In the MPLAB X IDE Project Properties window perform these actions: | Under Categories section, select Conf: (sam_d21_xpro), and in the Configuration section, select the hardware tool and compiler toolchain. | Click OK. | Connecting Hardware: Connect a micro-USB cable between the DEBUG USB on the board and the PC.

    "title": "Create IAR or Keil project using MHC",
    "content": "                                                                                                      . Creating an IAR or KEIL project using MHC . When creating projects for IAR or KEIL IDEs, MHC is launched as an application (as opposed to a plugin in MPLAB® X, when creating MPLAB® X projects). We refer to this mode of operation of MHC as “standalone” mode throughout this document. Follow the steps detailed below to create an project for IAR or KEIL using MHC . Launching MHC in standalone mode . Navigate to the local clone of this repository and run the script that is appropriate for your operating system. That is . For Windows, run the script runmhc.bat | For Linux/MacOS, run the script runmhc.sh | . This will launch the MHC as an application (see below): . . Setting user preferences . User preferences can be set by navigating to File -&gt; Preferences. MHC allows user to configure two preferences . Diff - Allows user to configure a diff tool. This is an important configuration, and is explained further down in project generation section. We can configure any third party diff tool. To set diff tool, navigate to its installation directory using the browse button and select the executable. {0} and {1} are place holders for the files that need to diffed during project file generation. In this example, we are using WinMerge as the diff tool. . . | Log - Allows user to set the log level. There are three levels of logging available (ALL, DEBUG, USER). MHC displays the logs in the console window (seen at the bottom of the main window). It also saves them in the mhc.log file under .mh3 folder in user’s home directory. This log level decides the kind of messages that will get logged. . . | . Creating a new configuration . To create a new mhc configuration, choose File -&gt; New configuration. A new configuration creation dialog will popup, where we can enter the details of the configuration that we are about to create. . . Framework Path - This is not configurable. Framework path defaults to the parent folder of the MHC repository. This folder is should contain relevant harmony 3 repositories required for project creation. Recommend using content manager for downloading and setting up Harmony 3 repositories. Make sure that the “Convert to relative path for configuration” check box is unchecked. . | Project information - Under project information, user can choose the location of the project, name of the project and the name of the configuration. Location - Location where the project and configuration will be created | Project name -Used by MHC when creating projects for target IDEs. If you want a KEIL or IAR project with specific name, it should be entered in this field | Configuration name - Used by MHC when creating configuration data | Path - Shows the location where the new configuration will be created. Paths used by MHC for creating the project and configuration follows these rules configuration information will be created under &lt;location&gt;/firmware/source/config/&lt;configuration_name&gt; folder. In this example it will be “D: Projects My_Harmony_3 firmware src config default” folder | IDE projects will be created under &lt;location&gt;/firmware/&lt;configuration_name&gt;.&lt;IDE name&gt; folder. In this example, if we choose to create an IAR project, it will be created under “D: Projects My_Harmony_3 firmware default.IAR” folder | . | . | Configuration Options - Allows us to choose the target device of this confifuration. Device Family drop down limits the options to a specific family when choosing the target device, while Device Filter allows searching for a device by entering few characters. In this instance, ATSAMC21N18A MCU is chosen for creating the configuration. | . Clicking finish button will popup a confirmation dialog. We can change the default Device Family Pack (DFP) and CMSIS Pack used for creating the configuration from this dialog. Click on the launch button to create a new configuration. . . Making changes to the configuration . Refer to documentation on how to use the project graph for configuring Harmony 3 components using mplabx Harmony 3 configurator. . Generating code and project associated with a configuration . . Select the target toolchain by clicking the system component in the project graph and choosing System -&gt; Project Configuration -&gt; Toolchain selections -&gt; Compilers in the configuration option window. Available options are XC32, IAR and KEIL. Some of these options might not be available for all targets. Choosing IAR or KEIL as the target compiler, will result in MHC creating IAR embedded workbench or Keil uVision IDE projects for the selected target. In this case, we have chosen KEIL as the toolchain. . | Select Generate - &gt; Generate code option in menu bar to start project generation. In the generation window, we can choose the merge strategies. . . | Based on the choosen merge startegy, when MHC identifies that there is a diff in the files it generated (for eg: modification within the project IDE), it will launch the configured diff tool. We can bring in the changes that are relevant and ignore the rest. Once the diff tool is closed, the project generation sequence is continued until the entire configuration is generated. . | If IAR or KEIL is chosen as the toolchain, MHC will also create a folder containing the relevant project files which can then be opened using the corresponding IDE. The path of this folder, follows the rules explained in the “configuration” section. In this example, it would be under &quot;D: Projects My_Harmony_3 firmware default.KEIL&quot;, since we choose keil as the the toolchain. . | . Note .

The following covers the basic MHC operations and code generation process, which helps users to setup and configure MHC according to their needs. . Selecting and Configuring Modules . After opening the MHC, the peripheral and library modules can be added to the project by following these steps: . In the Available Components Area, select the peripheral or library module which needs to be configured by clicking on the module’s name. See 2. below image. | Configure the peripheral as required for the application in the Configuration Options Area. | Configure the pins in the Pin Manager depending on the application requirements. | Code Generation . To perform the following actions, press MHC Generate button in the Project Resources window. . Saving and Loading the MHC Configuration . Saving and loading the MHC configuration is integrated into the MPLAB® X IDE Save and Load functions. The MHC configuration is saved whenever the Generate button is pressed. You can also save the MHC configuration by clicking on the MPLAB® X IDE Save tool or selecting Save from the File menu. The MHC configuration file is included in the MPLAB® X IDE project, under the Important Files folder. The configuration file uses the extension .xml. Double-clicking on the MHC configuration file will cause that MHC configuration to be loaded. . . . Merge Window . If any of the files generated by the MHC has been edited outside of MHC and saved to the disk, then the Merge [MHC] window will appear in the Configuration Options. The Merge [MHC] window allows you to decide whether to keep the edits, or to replace them with the MHC newly generated code. When the newly generated MHC content has been accepted, MHC makes the changes to the file. To the MPLAB® X IDE, these changes are the same as if you typed in the new content. The normal MPLAB® X IDE edit undo can be used in the MHC Merge operation. . A list of all the files that need to be merged appear one after another after resolving the merge conflicts. You must resolve merge conflicts to ensure that all the newly generated code is incorporated into the project. At the top of the Merge [MHC] window, in the center margin, there is an arrow, as shown in Figure 5-5. Clicking on the arrow will replace all your edits in the current file with the MHC updated code that the MHC has just generated. The numbers above the arrow indicate the current difference and the total number of differences. The individual lines of MHC Updated Code can be selected to replace the edited code. As shown in Figure 5-5, clicking on the arrows in the right margin of the left window will copy the MHC Updated Code to the generated driver file. Once the changes are accepted, the Merge mechanism will remove the highlighted file and highlight the next file on the list. To insure all updates are completed, a warning will be generated if the Merge mechanism is closed before all the changes are accepted. . Note: Your edits will never be overwritten by the MHC generated code, except by explicit action in the Merge [MHC] window. . When changes have been made both to a generated file and in the corresponding MHC UI within the Configuration Options, the Merge [MHC] window shown in Figure 5-5 will be displayed. The Merge [MHC] window allows you to resolve the conflicts between the newly generated file and the edits you have made to the file. . . Generated Source and Header Files . The generated code will be included in the active MPLAB® X IDE Project as shown in the below image. The header files are shown on the top and source files are shown on the bottom. . Note: In the image below, the icons are used to organize the project virtual organization of files, not an actual one. . .

The Project Graph displays all the instantiated component blocks. In Figure below BSP, USART and STDIO modules from Peripherals (CSP), I2C module from Harmony Core Driver, and FreeRTOS from Third-Party Software components are activated. MHC uses concept of Capability and Dependency for easy instantiation of modules. . Generic Capability and Dependency . A generic capability has a common name that identifies an interface that can be provided by a component but does not have an implementation of its own. One or more other components must implement the capability as shown in the following figure. . . Point 1: Indicates the concept of Generic capabilities and dependency, i.e. FreeRTOS has exposed a generic capability on “RTOS” on which Harmony Core Service has created a generic dependency, up on satisfying these generic dependencies the color will turn to Green. Non-required dependencies are indicated as Yellow and indicate optional functionality that will not inhibit the operation of the component if absent. Required dependencies will display as Red, indicating that an error will likely occur during generation, compilation, or at runtime if the dependency is not satisfied. Similarly, Harmony Core Service has exposed a generic capability “Core Service” on which I2C driver has created a generic dependency. Generic dependencies connect automatically to generic capabilities and no connector line is required to bind the two. | Point 2: Indicates how I2C dependency is satisfied by binding with the capability TWIHS0. The left side block is a capability i.e. TWIHS0 and the right-side block is a dependency i.e. “Instance 0” I2C. | Point 3: Indicates how a new component can be generated at run-time by clicking button creates a new generator database component. A generator database component can create unique instances of itself as needed. This is for things like components like bit-bang drivers that are defined in software, and thus can be added several times to a project if desired. Similarly, by clicking button deletes a component instantly. | Point 4: Indicates the available capability of I2C driver. As mention above a non-required dependency is indicated as Yellow and indicates optional functionality that will not inhibit the operation of the component if absent. | Point 5: Options to create, disband, add selected, view selected and configure group or container respectively. This is explained in detail in Section 5.3.2 Project Group Creation. The following figure illustrates the unsatisfied direct dependency for I2C driver. User can see the list of satisfiers for a direct dependency by right-clicking on Red color diamond button. | . Click button to adjust the “Canvas Size” and button for “Toggle Minimap”. . . Multi-Dependency and Multi-Capability . A component can have more than one dependency and capability respectively. The following figure illustrates the multi dependency and multi-capability feature of Harmony and shown with square block unlike a diamond block in single dependency. For example, in the below figure File System component is dependent on SD Card (SPI), SDHC and MEMORY components respectively whereas each of these exposes a DRV_MEDIA capability. . . Container or Group Creation . The following are different group options. The Root is the default group. See the figure 5.9 below. . Create Group or click : Creates a group. If user selects any component and clicks , then a pop-up is shown asking to automatically add selected components to the new group. | Disband Group or click : Deletes a selected group. User can delete one group at a time. If user selects any component and clicks , then a pop-up is shown asking to delete selected group. | Add selected to Group/Container or click : Adds selected component in to a target container. On clicking a pop-up with drop down menu option is shown asking user to select the target container. | View selected Group/Container or click : Select a group and click or double click a group to view the components grouped together in a container. | Configure Group Node or click : Select a group then click to display the connections of the components if any. On clicking a pop-up window is displayed showing the tabular list of available nodes, select the nodes to display in the group. | Select Next Highest Group or click : Selects the next highest group available. Root is the default group. Select a group and click or double click a group to view the components grouped together in a container then to select next highest group click or to select a group under a drop down Multiple components added to group or container. This helps in simplifying the Project Graph view. The following figure illustrates the grouping of SPI Driver and SPI PLIB components. Similarly, user can create any number of group or container based on the requirement. Say for example separate container for TCP/IP and USB and so on. or based on the application need. | . Note .

    "content": "                                                                                                      . Getting started with MPLAB® Harmony 3 on the SAMA5D2 . The SAMA5D2’s ROM boot loader looks for a second stage boot loader in external NVM, relocates it to internal SRAM, and executes it. Harmony uses the AT91Bootstrap as its second stage boot loader. The AT91Bootstrap initializes clocks, PIO, and DDR prior to relocating the application image from NVM to DDR and starting it. . As of the 3.2 release of Harmony only loading the AT91bootstrap and Harmony application from an external SD card has been tested. To boot your Harmony application for the SD card, first format the card with the FAT file system. Next, download the AT91Bootstrap binary from here and place the boot.bin on the SD card. . The next step is to download the Harmony 3 framework. This process can be automated using the MPLAB® Harmony Framework Management Tool. First clone the MHC repository found here and launch the harmony-content-manager.jar . java -jar harmony-content-manager.jar. . The downloader will clone the Harmony 3 repositories that you select. . NOTE: From here on when the document references launching MHC it refers to the mhc.jar file downloaded by the content manager with the mhc repository, along with the rest of the Harmony Framework. . Launching an Existing Project . Demo applications can be found in the apps directory in each Harmony repository downloaded. To load the demo application in MHC run: . java -jar mhc.jar -fw&quot;=(path to where you downloaded harmony)&quot; -mode=gui -c=&quot;(path to harmony.prj file associated with the demo application you&#39;d like to run. e.g. ../csp/apps/uart/uart_echo_interrupt/firmware/src/config/sam_a5d2_xult/harmony.prj)&quot; . NOTE: MHC must be launched from inside the mhc directory. You can’t be in another directory and give a path to mhc.jar, you must be inside the same directory as the mhc.jar file or MHC won’t run correctly. . Make sure the firmware path (-fw=) contains a trailing directory separator (/ on Linux, on Windows) . This will launch the existing project in MHC. For documentation on the demo applications shipped with Harmony refer to the github.io pages for the repository containing the app you’d like to run (e.g. csp) . Once the project is loaded the code can be regenerated by selecting . Generate-&gt;Generate Code . from the menu. . The IAR project has already been created for any demo applications and can be opened by opening (demo application’s firmware directory)/sam_a5d2_xult.IAR/(project name).eww. Once IAR is launched simply build the application and load the harmony.bin image as described below. . Creating a New Project . Once you’ve cloned the Harmony 3 framework launch MHC by running: . java -jar mhc.jar -fw=&quot;(path to where you downloaded harmony)&quot; -mode=gui. . With the MHC running create a new Harmony project under . File-&gt;New Configuration. . . NOTES: . As of the 3.2 release using relative paths in MHC causes issues when generating code. Please uncheck the box marked “Convert to Relative Path for Configuration” | The diff tool should be configured immediately after tool install, before code generation is attempted, otherwise User changes may be lost. Select File &gt; Preferences from the menu. | Enter the pathname to the executable file for your preferred “diff” tool and click Close. (Pass command line arguments as {0} {1} and so on.) | | Add the desired plibs, drivers, and system services your application requires and configure them accordingly, then generate the code. . To compile your project launch IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM. (Harmony has been tested with version 8.30.1 of IAR EW.) Make sure you have IAR configured to use project connections by going to . Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Project-&gt;Enable project connections. . . Create a new empty project in a new direcotry under the firmware directory created by MHC (e.g. HarmonyProjects/myApp/firmware/sam_a5d2_xult.IAR/myApp_sam_a5d2_xult.ewp). . . Under the Project menu bar select . Add Project Connection . . Browse to the ipcf file MHC generated. . . Since the AT91Bootstrap is looking to load a raw binary, we need to have IAR convert the ELF it builds into a raw binary. Right click on the project name and select options. Under Output Converter select the . Generate additional output . box, select Raw binary as the Output format, select the . Override default . box and type . harmony.bin . in the text field. . . Now build your application. Once the application is built copy the harmony.bin file that was generated to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the board, apply power, and your Harmony application should boot and run. . Debugging your application: . IAR supports source-level debugging of your application. First connect the SAM-ICE JTAG debugger to the JTAG header on the development board. Go to . Options-&gt;Debugger . and select . J-Link/J-Trace . as the Driver. If the application has booted from the SD card, simply load your project in IAR and select . Project-&gt;Attach to Running Target . This will allow you to halt the running program, set breakpoints, view and change memory and registers, etc. . Note . This page has been verified with the following versions of software tools: .

    "title": "Getting started with SAM MPU Devices on MPLAB X Tools",
    "content": "                                                                                                      . Getting started with MPLAB® Harmony 3 on Microchip SAM MPU’s . The SAM MPU’s, like the SAMA5D2 and SAM9X60, have a ROM based boot loader that looks for a second stage boot loader in external NVM, relocates it to internal SRAM, and executes it. Harmony uses the AT91Bootstrap as its second stage boot loader. The AT91Bootstrap initializes clocks, PIO, and DDR prior to relocating the application image from NVM to DDR and starting it. . To make development easier, rather than loading the AT91Bootstrap and Harmony images into NVM, we can use MPLAB X to load both the bootloader and application via the debug interface (e.g. JTAG/JLINK). The github page for the bootloader has instructions on how to configure and build on both Windows and Linux platforms. For now, we’ll just focus on only the configuration changes needed to build an image for use with MPLAB X. Some of our existing boards already have a defconfig for use with MPLAB X. Look for a defconfig with the name bkptnone in it, e.g, sama5d2_xplained_bkptnone_defconfig. You can then simply run: . make sama5d2_xplained_bkptnone_defconfig . If your board doesn’t already have a defconfig, not to worry, we can easily create one. To start, pick the defconfig for your board that runs out of some NVM, like an SD card, e.g. sama5d2_xplainedsd_uboot_defconfig. Run: . make sama5d2_xplainedsd_uboot_defconfig make menuconfig . Select “Image Loading Strategy” Select “Do not load any image after bootstrap run” . . Select “Build image for use with debuggers” . . Save the configuration and exit kconfig. Compile the bootloader. You’ll need the boot.bin file created as part of the build process. . Prebuilt binaries are also available in this repository. . SAMA5D2 SAMA5D2 XULT HARMONY | SAMA5D2 XULT MPLAB | . | SAM9X60 SAM9X60 EK HARMONY | SAM9X60 EK MPLAB | . | . Next we need to tell MPLAB X how to use the boot.bin image we just created or downloaded. We do this by creating a python script named autoload.py in the root folder of the MPLAB X project. For example, if we want to run the pit led_toggle_interrupt project we would create the autoload.py file in . .../csp/apps/pit/led_toggle_interrupt/firmware/sam_a5d2_xult_xc32.X . The contents of a typical autoload.py are shown below. . global g_mpu_config g_mpu_config = {&#39;type&#39;:&#39;application&#39;, &#39;entry_addr&#39;:0x26f00000, &#39;bootstrap_entry_addr&#39;:0x200000, &#39;bootstrap_bin_path&#39;:&#39;./boot.bin&#39;} def on_pre_program(): pass . Note that for the SAM9X60 the entry_addr is 0x23f00000 and the bootstrap_entry_addr is 0x300000. Now copy the boot.bin file from the AT91Bootstrap build done previously to the same directory where the autoload.py script is. . Now that the autoload.py and bootstrap are in place, we can use MPLAB X to download and debug our Harmony application. Start by loading the project in MPLAB X. Right click on the project name and select “Properties”. . . Select the correct HW debugging tool and Compiler. In this example the J-Link and XC-32 v2.41 are used. Simply hit the debug image button . . The IDE will connect to the hardware, load the bootloader, wait for it to enter debug mode, then load the Harmony application into DDR and execute it. You can set breakpoints, examine variables, and debug the hardware as you normally would. . Note . This page has been verified with the following versions of software tools: .

SAMC2x MCUs provide various sleep modes to meet the power consumption requirements of the application. The Power Manager (PM) module is responsible for controlling the low power modes. . SAMC2x supports two low power modes; IDLE and STANDBY. . Idle sleep mode: In Idle mode, CPU and Synchronous clocks are stopped except when requested. Idle mode allows power optimization with fast wakeup time. Standby sleep mode: In standby mode, the CPU is stopped as well as the peripherals, except those that are running using the RUN IN STANDBY option. Standby mode allows the device to consume the lowest power with little overhead on wakeup time. . The application makes use of the SAM C21 Xplained Pro evaluation kit and the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit (sold separately). . On power-up, the application is in sleep (standby) mode. The application wakes up from the sleep mode and enters active mode when you cover the light sensor (by placing a hand over it) on the I/O1 Xplained Pro extension kit. The application periodically prints room temperature on a serial terminal while the light sensor is covered. The application goes back to sleep (standby) mode when you uncover the light sensor. LED0 in the SAM C21 evaluation kit is toggled every time the temperature is displayed on the serial console. . When you press the switch SW0, the application switches sleep mode from standby mode to idle mode. . The application you create will utilize: . SERCOM (as I²C) Peripheral Library to read the temperature from the temperature sensor. | RTC Peripheral Library to periodically generate an event for the ADC to sample the light sensor. | SERCOM (as USART) and DMA Peripheral Libraries to print the temperature values on a COM (serial) port terminal application running on a PC. | PORT Peripheral Library to toggle the LED. | ADC Peripheral Library to sample the light sensor analog input and detect whether the light sensor is covered or not. | PM (Power Manager) and Supply Controller (SUPC) Peripheral Libraries to configure low power modes. | EIC (External Interrupt controller) Peripheral Library to control switch SW0. Event System Peripheral Library to trigger the start of the ADC conversion on every RTC compare match event. The event system allows for peripheral-to-peripheral communication without CPU intervention. This reduces the burden on the CPU and other resources when compared to the conventional interrupt-based systems. | . For more information refer the links below. . . Web Links .

    "content": "                                                                                                      . Create First MPLAB Harmony 3 Project . Overview . The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to use Microchip MPLAB® Harmony 3 to create a simple “heartbeat” LED application that flashes an LED using the MPLAB® X IDE and the MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC). As a bonus, you can reuse the heartbeat LED application in future projects as a simple indicator of system health. This tutorial focuses on direct use of MPLAB® Harmony peripheral libraries to build an application. If you are interested in using interoperable MPLAB® Harmony drivers, services, or middleware in your application, please see “Creating Your First Project – Harmony” when you’ve finished with this tutorial. The application can be defined by the following flowchart: . . Required Software . The instructions in this tutorial assume that you have already installed following software. . MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment | MPLAB XC32/32++ C Compiler | MPLAB Harmony Configurator | . Required Hardware . The instructions in this tutorial use SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kitand it has one Yellow Color user LED (PC05) connected GPIO. Similar kits will work similarly, but the setup and steps may not be exactly as described. . Setup: The following figure shows the hardware setup details: . Connect SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit micro USB port to PC using a micro USB cable | . Procedure . The following are the steps to create, generate, build and flash LED Blinking application. Before proceeding, make sure you have downloaded the required Harmony 3 packages (for directions, the MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) User’s Guide) and setup the required hardware as shown previously. . Create a new project . Open the MPLAB® X IDE. | Create a New Project by clicking the New Project icon or by selecting File &gt; New Project. | In the New Project window select 32-Bit MPLAB® Harmony 3 Project. | Click Next. Note: If 32-Bit MPLAB® Harmony 3 Project is not displayed, please download and install the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Configurator before continuing with these steps. | Enter the path to the folder in which you downloaded the MPLAB® Harmony 3 packages in the Framework Path edit box. | In the Project Setting dialog window, fill in or select the information needed as follows: Location: Create a “MyBlinky” folder in the location of your choice. | Folder: Project Folder name i.e. “sam_c21n_xpro” | Name: Project Name i.e. “my_blinky_sam_c21n_xpro” | . | In the Configuration Settings dialog window, enter the configuration name as “sam_c21n_xpro” and select the Target Device ATSAMC21N18A from the drop-down menu as shown below. | Click Finish. | When the Configuration Database Setup dialog appears, just click Launch as shown below to open MPLAB® Harmony Configurator plugin. If the below dialog window doesn’t appear then MHC can be launched by selecting MPLAB® Harmony 3 Configurator under Tools ? Embedded. | Setup MPLAB® Harmony Project Configurator to Generate Code . From the “Available Components” panel of MHC (on the left side of the MHC window), drag and drop the TC0 peripheral into the Components Graph: . | Click on the “TC0” component and configure as below and in the figure: Select Prescaler value to “Prescaler: GCLK_TC/1024” | Set Timer Period (Milli Sec) to “500” This will toggle the LED every 0.5 seconds, producing a LED blink every second. | . | Launch the Pin Configuration manager from the MHC’s Tools menu: | Setup pin “PC05” as the board’s LED, set custom name as “LED” and Direction as “Out”: This is necessary because the project doesn’t use a Board Support Package (BSP). . | Generate the application’s code for the first time. . | Select the Generate Code button of MHC’s window . | Save the project’s configuration (any name will do for the .xml file): . | Select default as the Merge Strategy (i.e. USER_ALL) and click Generate Now the project’s initial software has been configured. Note: Here is a brief explanation of the different merge strategies that are available: ALL: The user will be prompted with a merge window for all generated files. This includes files that have no user modifications but are changed because of changes in MHC configuration or component updates. (This choice is always the safest.) USER_ALL: The user will always be prompted with a merge window for all generated files that contain user modifications. USER_RECENT: The user will be prompted with a merge window for all generated files that contain user modifications. OVERWRITE: All generated file content will be replaced by the contents of this generate operation. All user changes will be overwritten. . | Let’s examine the software just created in the Projects panel of MPLAB® X IDE Header Files are shown on the top and Source Files are shown on the bottom. Note: the icons used in this picture of the project’s organization make it seem like the files of the project are organized this way on disk. In fact, this is a virtual organization of these files, not an actual one. On disk, the source and header files are not separated. The following table describes the Header and Source files generated from the sample project: | # Source File Descriptions . 1 | definitions.h | Provides configuration-specific definitions | . 2 | exceptions.c | Implements exception handlers | . 3 | initialization.c | Implements SYS_Initialize to initializes all libraries and applications | . 4 | interrupts.c | Implements the interrupt vectors | . 5 | peripheral [libraries] | Implements peripheral libraries used by the project | . 6 | startup.c | Startup code for the application | . If you click on the Files tab you will see the actual organization of these files on your drive: . Adding Code to main.c . Double click on main.c to bring up an editor window and update it to obtain the following code: . #include &quot;definitions.h&quot; // SYS function prototypes static bool volatile bToggleLED = false; // This function is called after period expires void TC0_CH0_TimerInterruptHandler(TC_TIMER_STATUS status, uintptr_t context) { bToggleLED = true; } // ***************************************************************************** // ***************************************************************************** // Section: Main Entry Point // ***************************************************************************** // ***************************************************************************** int main ( void ) { // Initialize all modules SYS_Initialize(NULL); // Register callback function for CH0 period interrupt TC0_TimerCallbackRegister(TC0_CH0_TimerInterruptHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL); // Start the timer channel 0 TC0_TimerStart(); while ( true ) { if ( bToggleLED ) { bToggleLED = false; LED_Toggle(); } } // Execution should not come here during normal operation return EXIT_FAILURE; } . If you do a control click on “LED_Toggle()” the editor will bring up where this token is defined in the file plib_port.h: . . . Upload project to SAMC21N Xplained pro Evaluation Kit . Do a right mouse click on the project’s name and bring up the Project Properties dialog: . | Under Categories section, select Conf: (sam_c21n_xpro), and in the Configuration section, select the hardware tool and XC32 Compiler toolchain (here v2.41). Click Apply, and then click OK . | Build and run the project: The board’s LED should flash with a 1 second period . | We have now implemented a heartbeat for future applications. The LED blinking indicates that the application hasn’t frozen or isn’t stuck in a while(1){} loop (e.g.: assert or exception). . Result . If configured correctly, the LED PC05 on the SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit should now flash ON/OFF at 500 ms intervals. . Note . This page has been verified with the following versions of software tools: . MPLAB Harmony v3 “csp” repo v3.7.1 | MPLAB Harmony v3 “dev_packs” repo v3.7.0 | MPLAB Harmony v3 “mhc” repo v3.4.0 | MPLAB Harmony Configurator Plugin v3.5.0 | MPLAB X IDE v5.40 | MPLAB XC32 Compiler v2.41 | . Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally there could be minor differences with the newer versions of the tools. . References .
