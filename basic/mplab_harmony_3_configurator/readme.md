# MPLAB Harmony 3 Configurator (MHC)

## Introduction

<a href="https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony" target="_blank">MPLAB Harmony 3 </a> is a vital part of the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/development-tools/" target="_blank">MPLAB development tools </a> ecosystem for working with <a href="https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit" target="_blank">Microchip 32-bit </a> SAM® and PIC® micro controllers. It consists of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) called the MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) and an extensive set of interoperable firmware libraries that accelerate the process of developing embedded applications. The fundamental MHC GUI tools are the content manager and configurator tools. The content manager tool simplifies the process of downloading the firmware libraries, demonstration applications, and extensions to the MHC GUI. The configurator tool provides a convenient GUI for selecting libraries, initialization parameters, and optional features. It also makes it easy to connect everything together and generate C language code in a working configuration for your project.

This section describes the following MHC specific topics to get started using MPLAB® Harmony to develop embedded applications designed with Microchip 32-bit micro controllers.

**Note**: The components shown under components are based on the Microcontroller selected while creating the project. All operating areas are dockable. Each can be dragged and dropped into another position, even out of the MPLAB® X IDE main window. However, closing the IDE however will close all MHC windows, including the ones moved outside the IDE.

### <a id="Active-Components,-Project-Graph-and-Configuration-Options"> </a>
### Active Components, Project Graph and Configuration Options

Active Component and Project Graph displays all the instantiated components. By default, the below essential components from the Chip Specific Package (CSP) repo will get auto instantiated.

- System: The CSP System component is used for the device and project specific configurations.
- CMSIS Pack: The Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) Pack is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for the Cortex®-M processor series and defines generic tool interfaces. This pack is needed for 32-bit SAM MCU devices.
- Device Family Pack (DFP): This is the Microchip Device Family Pack retrieves the device specific information and instantiates the same.  

The following figure displays Active Components and Project Graph Area. Along with above mentioned default components, it consists of other active components like BSP, Harmony Core, I2C Driver, TWIHS, USART, SDTIO and FreeRTOS which are activated/instantiated by user.  
<img src = "images/figure_5.2.png" width="700" height="305" align="middle">  
The following figure displays the project configuration of selected active “System” component. User can modify/configure activated component by selecting a component under Active component or under Project Graph. This way user can do the configuration of selected component.
